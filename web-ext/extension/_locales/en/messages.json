Using this information, we will be able to tell if the algorithms that decide what users see give priority to certain type of content and if they censor other types of content.\n\nThe results of the investigation will be published by [AlgorithmWatch](https://algorithmwatch.org/) and their media partners.\n\n##### Leaving the project\n\nJust uninstall the extension to stop the data collection. You can also unfollow any of the 3 accounts that you followed for the experiment to stop the data collection.\n\n##### Privacy\n\nThe extension only records data about some of the accounts you follow and the date and time at which content from certain accounts appear in your newsfeed. Your user name is pseudonymized using a one-way cryptographic hash function, so that it is impossible to identify you.\n\nThe data will only ever be used for the journalistic investigation \"Monitoring Instagram\" and will never be sold or shared with any third-parties.\n\n##### Contact\n\nShould you have any question about this project, contact Nicolas Kayser-Bril, reporter at AlgorithmWatch, at [nkb@algorithmwatch.org](mailto:nkb@algorithmwatch.org)",
